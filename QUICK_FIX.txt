                    VERCEL DEPLOYMENT FIX                         ║



 FILE CONTENT (copy exactly as shown):                           │


{
  "buildCommand": "vite build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "framework": "vite",
  "installCommand": "pnpm install"
}


 STEPS TO FIX:                                                    │


1. In your Git repository, create a new file called: vercel.json
   
2. Copy the content above into vercel.json

3. Commit and push:
   git add vercel.json
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment"
   git push

4. Vercel will automatically redeploy - it should work now! ✅


 WHY THIS WORKS:                                                  │


Your package.json was trying to build to /tmp/outdir, but Vercel 
cannot access /tmp directory. This vercel.json file tells Vercel to 
use the standard "vite build" command which outputs to "dist" 
directory instead.


  That's it! Just create this ONE file and push to Git.          ║
